svg_plot
========

Plot data in SVG format using C++ library.

The SVG_plot C++ library allows, with a few lines of C++ code, to add plotting of data, held in STL containers like vector and map, output as SVG files that can be viewed by all modern browsers.

1D, 2D and Boxplots can be produced, and there are a myriad of options to control appearance.

The plots are very high quality and can be expanded without loss of quality (no pixelation!) but are tiny, (compared for a Microsoft Excel plot, for example) and are easily compressible, making them suitable for real-time transmission and update.

The SVG_plot project was originally written by Jake Voytko in 2007 as a Boost-sponsored Google Summer of Code project in 2007. It has been maintained and enhanced since then in Boost Sandbox, but is judged unsuitable for a Boost Library, so now being made more widely available here.

Version 2 adds representation of uncertainty estimates as numbers and zones.
